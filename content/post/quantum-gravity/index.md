title: 'A story of two times'
subtitle: 'The problem between relativity and the quantum'
summary: Attempting to reconcile general relativity with quantum mechanics is one of the great undertakings of contemporary physics. In this article, I've presented the incompatibility between the two theories arises in the simple thought experiment of preparing a heavy object in a quantum superposition.

When asking colleagues why they are pursuing a certain research direction, I have often heard "because it's fun". This bothers me: Shouldn't all academics be capable of providing an honest narrative explaining why our chosen research direction is of value (other than personal pleasure)?

I think it's fine if "fun" is an intrinsic motivation for choosing academia as a career, I even think this is necessary to success. I also don't think we should be forced into a certain definition of “useful research”. The concept of usefulness or value can differ per individuals. But shouldn't one have a strong explanation for the value of one's research other than one’s own enjoyment? I think we can distinguish 3 reasons why someone would say "because it's fun".

**Number 1: One has no explanation beyond one's own enjoyment.** I tend to think this is unethical. In the case of fundemental research we are mostly funded by tax-money. There should thus be an explanation why this investement is of potential value for tax-payers. This all seems pretty logical, but things get a bit more tricky when you look at the history of science. Take Riemann for example, in the early 1800s, he was spending his time working on geometry in arbitrary dimensions. I have trouble imagining why he was doing this (except having fun). Yet nearly a century later, it became the cornerstone of general relativity, which shaped our understanding of the cosmos, sending shivers down your spine throught the medium of Neil deGrasse Tyson on Cosmos. But how can we ethically justify pouring tax into someones enjoyment, without any potential value on the horizon? The next point may relax this very black-and-white discussion.

**Number 2. "Fun" is a short-hand for "interesting, but I don't know why".** One can have a gut feeling that investigating a topic will lead to relevant results, but can't quite express what could be the outcomes. Sometimes it's impossible. Sometimes, one's insight is evolving so fast, that the potential of a topic is changing every day. But I do urge researchers, when it's possible, to invest significant time and brain-energy into trying to properly answer "why?" for themselves. 

In academia we often lack the clear goals that the farmer, or the doctor is blessed with. As a result I find myself often plagued with occasional bounts of existential crisis, having a clear formulation of my research goals can be called to the rescue in such times, and you will be more at peace with your life commitment. Additionally, whilst research may be fun most of the time, one inevitable encouters tough moments: one may have to spend months debugging an experiment, or find oneself rewriting a paper for the tenth time. If the worthiness of the goal does not match the magnitude of the struggle, adversity can triumph and you may abandon an extremely valuable endeavor. In extreme cases of this, especially young researchers can find themselves just shrugging and saying tothemselves "why am I putting myself through this?", and simply leave science. In my experience a lot of talent is lost in this way.

**Number 3. The person has found his intrinsic motivation for choosing his direction of research, but isn't stating it clearly.** This can be out of laziness when preparing a talk. Or maybe you can't be bothered to go into details at a social event with a colleague. But this can also result from fear: someone who has ambitions to unite the laws of physics for example, could be afraid of being hit with a "who do you think you are?". So publically comitting to highly ambitious goals takes a lot of courage and self-confidence. 

Whatever the reason, I think this is missing an extremely important opportunity. You are losing out on the opportunity to inspire those around you who have not found your level of clarity. The more we answer "because it's fun", the more we tend to hurt our communal sense of purpose, which is so essential to dealing with the adversity we inevitable face as researchers.

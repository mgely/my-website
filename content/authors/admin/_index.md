If you don't know me, I'm a french researcher currently working in the Technical University of Delft in the Netherlands (at [Steele Lab](https://steelelab.tudelft.nl/)).

This is a place to share stuff that doesn't fit in the mold of scientific publications.

You can expect posts about:
 - Physics (gravitating around the field of superconducting circuits)
 - Programming (Python based)
 - Music (DIY tech-y topics)
